# üç¨ Candy Vending Machine using Moore State Machine (Verilog HDL)

This project implements a **Candy Vending Machine** using a **Moore Finite State Machine (FSM)** in Verilog. The vending machine accepts ‚Çπ5 and ‚Çπ10 coins and dispenses candy once the total inserted amount is ‚Çπ15 or more. This is an ideal project for understanding state machines in digital design using Verilog HDL.

## üîß Overview

The vending machine is modeled using a **Moore FSM**, meaning the output (`candy`) depends only on the current state, not the inputs. The machine progresses through a series of states representing the total money inserted, and when it reaches ‚Çπ15 or ‚Çπ20, it dispenses a candy.

##  FSM Design

The machine has the following states:

| State | Binary Code | Total Money Inserted |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| `s0`  | `0000`      | ‚Çπ0                   |
| `s5`  | `0001`      | ‚Çπ5                   |
| `s10` | `0010`      | ‚Çπ10                  |
| `s15` | `0011`      | ‚Çπ15 (Candy)          |
| `s20` | `0100`      | ‚Çπ20 (Candy)          |

The coin input is 4-bit wide and accepts:

- `rupee5` = `0101` (decimal 5)
- `rupee10` = `1010` (decimal 10)

###  Candy Dispense Condition

- Candy is dispensed when the machine reaches **state `s15` or `s20`**.
- Once candy is dispensed, the machine returns to the initial state (`s0`) to start a new cycle.

##  Verilog Module Description

### Inputs:

- `clk`: Clock signal
- `rst`: Asynchronous reset signal
- `coin[3:0]`: 4-bit input representing either ‚Çπ5 or ‚Çπ10

### Output:

- `candy`: Output that is high (1) when candy is dispensed

### State Transition Logic

`verilog
always@(posedge clk)
begin
    if(rst)
        present_state = s0;
    else
        present_state = next_state;
end`

### Combinational Logic for Next State
Each state checks the inserted coin and transitions accordingly:

``verilog
case(present_state)
    s0: if(coin == rupee5) next_state <= s5;
        else if(coin == rupee10) next_state <= s10;
        else next_state <= s0;

    s5: ...
    s10: ...
    ...
endcase``

### Output Logic
As this is a Moore machine, the output depends only on the current state:

verilog
`assign candy = (present_state == s15 || present_state == s20) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;`

 Why This Project is Important

- Teaches Finite State Machine (FSM) design in hardware
- Demonstrates Moore vs Mealy machine concepts
