This state diagram represents a Moore Finite State Machine (FSM) for a Candy Vending Machine that accepts ₹5 and ₹10 coins.

🧾 States and Meanings
Each state represents the total money inserted so far:
--------------------------------------
State|Label	|        Meaning         |
--------------------------------------
s0	 |₹0    |	    No money inserted  |
s5	 |₹5    |	    ₹5 inserted        |
s10	 |₹10   |	   ₹10 inserted        |
s15	 |₹15   |	   Candy dispensed     |
s20	 |₹20   |	   Candy dispensed     |
--------------------------------------

🔁 Transitions Based on Input Coins
From s0:
₹5 → s5
₹10 → s10
₹0 → Remain in s0 (invalid or no input)

From s5:
₹5 → s10
₹10 → s15 → 🍬 Candy dispensed

From s10:
₹5 → s15 → 🍬 Candy
₹10 → s20 → 🍬 Candy

From s15:
Automatically resets to s0 after dispensing candy

From s20:
Automatically resets to s0 after dispensing candy

If ₹5 is inserted again before reset, it may lead to undefined behavior unless restricted

🍬 Candy Dispense Logic
Candy is only dispensed in states s15 and s20.
This is a Moore machine, so output (candy) is tied only to the current state, not input.
